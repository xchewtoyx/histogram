A simple command line app to read in a log file and produce some
distribution statistics and histograms.

usage:

histogram.py -i INPUTFILE -p PATTERN

PATTERN is a regular expression with a capture group to identify
the data to analyse.

Optional arguments:

--bins Number of bins to display in the histogram

--zoom

Zoom in on certain percentile bands. This is a colon separated list
of positive integers that must sum to 100. For example the default
of 80:20 will display a distribution of the 80th centile and then
a distribution of the remainder. 10:80:10 would display three
distributions, distribution of values in the 10th centile, the
11-90th centile and the 91-100th centile. To disable zoom provide
an empty string to this argument, or a valid distribution starting
with 0: (e.g. 0:100).
